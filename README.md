# ⚽ Maç Kolay - Small-Sided Football Match Organizer

**Developed on Replit.** This is a robust full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of organizing, joining, and managing local "halı saha" (small-sided football) matches in Turkey. The platform focuses on accountability and seamless user experience.

## ✨ Core Features & Functionality

* **Secure Authentication:** User registration (`/kayit`) and login (`/giris`) with password hashing and session persistence, fixed for public deployment environments.
* **Reliability Score System:** A **"Güvenilirlik Puanı"** (Reliability Score) is implemented (default 50), with logic to penalize users for last-minute match cancellations, promoting accountability.
* **Match Management:**
    * **Search & Post:** Users can filter available matches (`/mac-bul`) or post new match requirements.
    * **Homepage Integration:** Search parameters from the homepage are automatically passed to the search page for an immediate, filtered display.
    * **Match Synchronization (Maçlarım):** Users can track all matches they have created or joined under the dedicated **"Maçlarım"** tab.
* **UX & Data Safety:**
    * **Instant State Update:** The navigation bar updates immediately upon login (e.g., showing the profile link), resolving critical UX delays.
    * **Secured Contact:** The match organizer's phone number is only revealed to users who have successfully joined the match.
