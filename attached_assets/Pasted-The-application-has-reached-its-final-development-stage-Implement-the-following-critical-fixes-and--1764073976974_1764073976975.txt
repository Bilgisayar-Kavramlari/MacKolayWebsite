The application has reached its final development stage. Implement the following critical fixes and new features exactly as requested by the user:

1. Match Creation Bug Fix and Logic Update
Logic Review: Review the match posting logic (POST /mac-ilan-ver) and the resulting match listing component.

Crucial Fix: Fix the bug where the user's input for the number of players needed (ihtiyac_duyulan_oyuncu_sayisi) is incorrectly displayed as the total player count (e.g., if the user needs 1 player, the listing shows the match has only 1 total spot).

Requirement: The display in the match listing must accurately reflect how many players are still needed (i.e., the ihtiyac_duyulan_oyuncu_sayisi value).

2. UX/Performance Fix: Immediate Navigation Update
State Management: Improve the frontend authentication state management in the main application layout (App.tsx or the main navigation component).

Immediate Update: The navigation bar elements (specifically the visibility of "Maç Oluştur", profile links/pictures, and the disappearance of "Giriş Yap"/"Kayıt Ol") must update instantly upon a successful POST /giris (login) request. The navigation should reflect the logged-in state without requiring a manual tab switch or page refresh.

3. New Feature: "Maçlarım" (My Matches) Tab
Frontend Navigation: Add a new navigation link titled "Maçlarım" to the main header bar. This link must only be visible when the user is authenticated (logged in). Link the tab to the /maclarim route.

Frontend Component: Create a new component file (e.g., client/src/pages/Maclarim.tsx) and define the corresponding route in the React Router setup. The page content should initially display a placeholder list of matches created by or joined by the current user.

Backend API: Create a new authenticated Express API endpoint (e.g., GET /api/maclarim). This endpoint should eventually query the match data and filter results to return matches relevant to the authenticated user.

4. Data Initialization: Default Reliability Score
Registration Logic Update: Update the user registration logic (POST /kayit in the backend) to set the default value of the guvenilirlik_puani field for all newly registered users to exactly 50. This value must be persisted in the users.json file during the registration process.

Final Deployment Steps
Ensure all new and modified files are included in the project.

Compile the application: npm run build

Start the server: npm start

Verify all user-facing elements remain in Turkish.
